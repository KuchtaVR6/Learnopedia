    Please keep in mind these guidelines whenever receiving email correspondence from us:
1. We will always refer to you by your full name, we would never use greetings like: "Welcome User" or "Dear Member".
2. We will never contact asking to perform some action on your account, if someone you don't trust is asking you to perform some actions on your account they most likely are scammers.
3. Do not share the verification codes with anyone. They are a powerful tool that we use to verify that actions taken on your account are genuine.
4. If you receive an email for an action you didn't request, ignore the email and change your password immediately.
